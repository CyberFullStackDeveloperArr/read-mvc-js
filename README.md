| MVC Vanila JS |
|----------|
| <div style="text-align: justify;">This project is an implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture using JavaScript. The Model is responsible for managing data, the View displays the user interface, and the Controller connects the two. Data is taken from a JSON file that contains the information to be displayed. When the application is run, the Controller will call the Model to get data from the JSON and then pass the data to the View. The View will render the data into the user interface, so that users can see the information clearly. With this approach, the application becomes more structured and easy to maintain.</div>    |
